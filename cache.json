In this study,\nwe present a new framework to surveil public health, focusing on mental health\n(MH) outcomes. We hypothesize that locally posted tweets are indicative of\nlocal MH outcomes and collect tweets posted from 765 neighborhoods (census\nblock groups) in the USA. We pair these tweets from each neighborhood with the\ncorresponding MH outcome reported by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to\ncreate a benchmark dataset, LocalTweets. With LocalTweets, we present the first\npopulation-level evaluation task for Twitter-based MH surveillance systems. We\nthen develop an efficient and effective method, LocalHealth, for predicting MH\noutcomes based on LocalTweets. When used with GPT3.5, LocalHealth achieves the\nhighest F1-score and accuracy of 0.7429 and 79.78\\%, respectively, a 59\\%\nimprovement in F1-score over the GPT3.5 in zero-shot setting. We also utilize\nLocalHealth to extrapolate CDC's estimates to proxy unreported neighborhoods,\nachieving an F1-score of 0.7291.

A much\nmore efficient solution is to continually pre-train these models, saving\nsignificant compute compared to re-training. However, the distribution shift\ninduced by new data typically results in degraded performance on previous data\nor poor adaptation to the new data. In this work, we show that a simple and\nscalable combination of learning rate (LR) re-warming, LR re-decaying, and\nreplay of previous data is sufficient to match the performance of fully\nre-training from scratch on all available data, as measured by the final loss\nand the average score on several language model (LM) evaluation benchmarks.\nSpecifically, we show this for a weak but realistic distribution shift between\ntwo commonly used LLM pre-training datasets (English$\\rightarrow$English) and a\nstronger distribution shift (English$\\rightarrow$German) at the $405$M\nparameter model scale with large dataset sizes (hundreds of billions of\ntokens). Selecting the weak but realistic shift for larger-scale experiments,\nwe also find that our continual learning strategies match the re-training\nbaseline for a 10B parameter LLM. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can be\nsuccessfully updated via simple and scalable continual learning strategies,\nmatching the re-training baseline using only a fraction of the compute.\nFinally, inspired by previous work, we propose alternatives to the cosine\nlearning rate schedule that help circumvent forgetting induced by LR re-warming\nand that are not bound to a fixed token budget.\n","authors":["Adam Ibrahim","Benjamin Thérien","Kshitij Gupta","Mats L.

Copyright law distinguishes between\noriginal expressions and generic ones (Sc\\`enes \\`a faire), protecting the\nformer and permitting reproduction of the latter. However, this distinction has\nhistorically been challenging to make consistently, leading to over-protection\nof copyrighted works. GenAI offers an unprecedented opportunity to enhance this\nlegal analysis by revealing shared patterns in preexisting works. We propose a\ndata-driven approach to identify the genericity of works created by GenAI,\nemploying \"data-driven bias\" to assess the genericity of expressive\ncompositions. This approach aids in copyright scope determination by utilizing\nthe capabilities of GenAI to identify and prioritize expressive elements and\nrank them according to their frequency in the model's dataset. The potential\nimplications of measuring expressive genericity for copyright law are profound.\nSuch scoring could assist courts in determining copyright scope during\nlitigation, inform the registration practices of Copyright Offices, allowing\nregistration of only highly original synthetic works, and help copyright owners\nsignal the value of their works and facilitate fairer licensing deals. More\ngenerally, this approach offers valuable insights to policymakers grappling\nwith adapting copyright law to the challenges posed by the era of GenAI.\n","authors":["Uri Hacohen","Adi Haviv","Shahar Sarfaty","Bruria Friedman","Niva Elkin-Koren","Roi Livni","Amit H Bermano"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17691v1.pdf","comment":"Presented at ACM CSLAW 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14230v2","updated":"2024-03-26T13:16:37Z","published":"2023-05-23T16:46:18Z","title":"Exploring Representational Disparities Between Multilingual and\n  Bilingual Translation Models","summary":"  Multilingual machine translation has proven immensely useful for both\nparameter efficiency and overall performance across many language pairs via\ncomplete multilingual parameter sharing.

Models trained with coarse-grained texts may not be able to\nlearn mappings from fine-grained motion-related words to motion primitives,\nresulting in the failure to generate motions from unseen descriptions. In this\npaper, we build a large-scale language-motion dataset specializing in\nfine-grained textual descriptions, FineHumanML3D, by feeding GPT-3.5-turbo with\nstep-by-step instructions with pseudo-code compulsory checks. Accordingly, we\ndesign a new text2motion model, FineMotionDiffuse, making full use of\nfine-grained textual information. Our quantitative evaluation shows that\nFineMotionDiffuse trained on FineHumanML3D improves FID by a large margin of\n0.38, compared with competitive baselines. According to the qualitative\nevaluation and case study, our model outperforms MotionDiffuse in generating\nspatially or chronologically composite motions, by learning the implicit\nmappings from fine-grained descriptions to the corresponding basic motions.

While\nspeculative and parallel decoding techniques attempt to mitigate this, they\nface limitations: either relying on less accurate smaller models for generation\nor failing to fully leverage the base LLM's representations.\n  We introduce a novel architecture, Tandem transformers, to address these\nissues. This architecture uniquely combines (1) a small autoregressive model\nand (2) a large model operating in block mode (processing multiple tokens\nsimultaneously). The small model's predictive accuracy is substantially\nenhanced by granting it attention to the large model's richer representations.\nOn the PaLM2 pretraining dataset, a tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko\ndemonstrates a 3.3% improvement in next-token prediction accuracy over a\nstandalone PaLM2-Gecko, offering a 1.16x speedup compared to a PaLM2-Otter\nmodel with comparable downstream performance. We further incorporate the tandem\nmodel within the speculative decoding (SPEED) framework where the large model\nvalidates tokens from the small model. This ensures that the Tandem of\nPaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko achieves substantial speedup (around 1.14x faster\nthan using vanilla PaLM2-Gecko in SPEED) while maintaining identical downstream\ntask accuracy.\n","authors":["Aishwarya P S","Pranav Ajit Nair","Yashas Samaga","Toby Boyd","Sanjiv Kumar","Prateek Jain","Praneeth Netrapalli"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08644v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17599v1","updated":"2024-03-26T11:09:58Z","published":"2024-03-26T11:09:58Z","title":"Coimagining the Future of Voice Assistants with Cultural Sensitivity","summary":"  Voice assistants (VAs) are becoming a feature of our everyday life.

The segmentation ambiguity problem,\nwhich arises when using language models based on subwords, leads to occasional\ndecoding failures in all neural language steganography implementations based on\nthese models. Current solutions to this issue involve altering the probability\ndistribution of candidate words, rendering them incompatible with provably\nsecure steganography. We propose a novel secure disambiguation method named\nSyncPool, which effectively addresses the segmentation ambiguity problem.

To enable the receiver to synchronize the sampling process of\nthe sender, a shared cryptographically-secure pseudorandom number generator\n(CSPRNG) is deployed to select a token from the ambiguity pool.

This challenge is even more for regional\nBengali dialects due to unavailability of standardized spelling conventions for\nthese dialects, presence of local and foreign words popular in those regions\nand phonological diversity across different regions. This paper presents an\napproach to this sequence-to-sequence problem by introducing the District\nGuided Tokens (DGT) technique on a new dataset spanning six districts of\nBangladesh. The key idea is to provide the model with explicit information\nabout the regional dialect or \"district\" of the input text before generating\nthe IPA transcription. This is achieved by prepending a district token to the\ninput sequence, effectively guiding the model to understand the unique phonetic\npatterns associated with each district. The DGT technique is applied to\nfine-tune several transformer-based models, on this new dataset. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of DGT, with the ByT5 model achieving\nsuperior performance over word-based models like mT5, BanglaT5, and umT5.

TDT systems aim to cluster a corpus of news articles by event,\nand in that context, stories that describe the same event are likely to have\nbeen written at around the same time. Prior work on time modeling for TDT takes\nthis into account, but does not well capture how time interacts with the\nsemantic nature of the event. For example, stories about a tropical storm are\nlikely to be written within a short time interval, while stories about a movie\nrelease may appear over weeks or months. In our work, we design a neural method\nthat fuses temporal and textual information into a single representation of\nnews documents for event detection. We fine-tune these time-aware document\nembeddings with a triplet loss architecture, integrate the model into\ndownstream TDT systems, and evaluate the systems on two benchmark TDT data sets\nin English. In the retrospective setting, we apply clustering algorithms to the\ntime-aware embeddings and show substantial improvements over baselines on the\nNews2013 data set.

Investigating and Mitigating Prompt Bias\n  in Factual Knowledge Extraction","summary":"  Recent research shows that pre-trained language models (PLMs) suffer from\n\"prompt bias\" in factual knowledge extraction, i.e., prompts tend to introduce\nbiases toward specific labels. Prompt bias presents a significant challenge in\nassessing the factual knowledge within PLMs. Therefore, this paper aims to\nimprove the reliability of existing benchmarks by thoroughly investigating and\nmitigating prompt bias. We show that: 1) all prompts in the experiments exhibit\nnon-negligible bias, with gradient-based prompts like AutoPrompt and OptiPrompt\ndisplaying significantly higher levels of bias; 2) prompt bias can amplify\nbenchmark accuracy unreasonably by overfitting the test datasets, especially on\nimbalanced datasets like LAMA. Based on these findings, we propose a\nrepresentation-based approach to mitigate the prompt bias during inference\ntime. Specifically, we first estimate the biased representation using\nprompt-only querying, and then remove it from the model's internal\nrepresentations to generate the debiased representations, which are used to\nproduce the final debiased outputs. Experiments across various prompts, PLMs,\nand benchmarks show that our approach can not only correct the overfitted\nperformance caused by prompt bias, but also significantly improve the prompt\nretrieval capability (up to 10% absolute performance gain). These results\nindicate that our approach effectively alleviates prompt bias in knowledge\nevaluation, thereby enhancing the reliability of benchmark assessments.\nHopefully, our plug-and-play approach can be a golden standard to strengthen\nPLMs toward reliable knowledge bases.

We focus\non two distinct tasks: a visually evident task of detecting simple triggers,\nsuch as small squares in images, indicative of potential backdoors, and a\nnon-visually evident task of malware classification through visual\nrepresentations. Our results highlight a significant divergence in performance,\nwith Gemini-pro falling short in accuracy and reliability when compared to\nfine-tuned ViT models. The ViT models, on the other hand, demonstrate\nexceptional accuracy, achieving near-perfect performance on both tasks. This\nstudy not only showcases the strengths and limitations of prompt-engineered\nLMMs in cybersecurity applications but also emphasizes the unmatched efficacy\nof fine-tuned ViT models for precise and dependable tasks.\n","authors":["Fouad Trad","Ali Chehab"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17787v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17782v1","updated":"2024-03-26T15:15:15Z","published":"2024-03-26T15:15:15Z","title":"GenesisTex: Adapting Image Denoising Diffusion to Texture Space","summary":"  We present GenesisTex, a novel method for synthesizing textures for 3D\ngeometries from text descriptions.

Firstly, we leverage an ensemble of publicly\navailable 3D datasets to facilitate the training of large-scale models.

The capacity of conditional generation can thus be\nrealized by simply concatenating various conditioning inputs to the latent\nvector, such as point clouds, categories, images, and texts. In addition,\nthanks to the simplicity of our model architecture, we naturally scale up our\napproach to a larger model with an impressive 3.6 billion parameters, further\nenhancing the quality of versatile 3D generation.

Traditional\nmethods for data copyright protection are applied prior to data distribution,\nimplying that models trained on these data become uncontrollable. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach, named DataCook, designed to safeguard the\ncopyright of healthcare data during the deployment phase. DataCook operates by\n\"cooking\" the raw data before distribution, enabling the development of models\nthat perform normally on this processed data. However, during the deployment\nphase, the original test data must be also \"cooked\" through DataCook to ensure\nnormal model performance.

However, we identify two key\nlimitations in a conventional label assignment for training Transformer-based\nVRD models, which is a process of mapping a ground-truth (GT) to a prediction.\nUnder the conventional assignment, an unspecialized query is trained since a\nquery is expected to detect every relation, which makes it difficult for a\nquery to specialize in specific relations. Furthermore, a query is also\ninsufficiently trained since a GT is assigned only to a single prediction,\ntherefore near-correct or even correct predictions are suppressed by being\nassigned no relation as a GT. To address these issues, we propose Groupwise\nQuery Specialization and Quality-Aware Multi-Assignment (SpeaQ). Groupwise\nQuery Specialization trains a specialized query by dividing queries and\nrelations into disjoint groups and directing a query in a specific query group\nsolely toward relations in the corresponding relation group.

Existing learning-based\nNLOS methods usually train independent models for different light transport\nconditions, which is computationally inefficient and impairs the practicality\nof the models. In this work, we propose NLOS-LTM, a novel passive NLOS imaging\nmethod that effectively handles multiple light transport conditions with a\nsingle network.

This metric can be\nassessed per-cell or averaged across a validation set, offering a tool to audit\nindividual features vectors or guide the improved design of deep learning\narchitectures. Importantly, Grad-CAMO seamlessly integrates into existing\nworkflows, requiring no dataset or model modifications, and is compatible with\nboth 2D and 3D Cell Painting data.

However,\nmost of the foot-contact annotations in existing datasets are estimated by\npurely visual matching and distance thresholding, which results in low accuracy\nand coarse granularity. Even though existing multimodal datasets\nsynergistically capture plantar pressure (foot contact) and visual signals,\nthey are specifically designed for small-range and slow motion such as Taiji\nQuan and Yoga. Therefore, there is still a lack of a vision-pressure multimodal\ndataset with large-range and fast human motion, as well as accurate and dense\nfoot-contact annotation. To fill this gap, we propose a Multimodal MoCap\nDataset with Vision and Pressure sensors, named MMVP. MMVP provides accurate\nand dense plantar pressure signals synchronized with RGBD observations, which\nis especially useful for both plausible shape estimation, robust pose fitting\nwithout foot drifting, and accurate global translation tracking. To validate\nthe dataset, we propose an RGBD-P SMPL fitting method and also a\nmonocular-video-based baseline framework, VP-MoCap, for human motion capture.\nExperiments demonstrate that our RGBD-P SMPL Fitting results significantly\noutperform pure visual motion capture. Moreover, VP-MoCap outperforms SOTA\nmethods in foot-contact and global translation estimation accuracy.

For graphic sketch representation learning, recent studies have\ninjected sketch drawing orders into graph edge construction by linking each\npatch to another in accordance to a temporal-based nearest neighboring\nstrategy. However, such constructed graph edges may be unreliable, since a\nsketch could have variants of drawings. In this paper, we propose a\nvariant-drawing-protected method by equipping sketch patches with context-aware\npositional encoding (PE) to make better use of drawing orders for learning\ngraphic sketch representation. Instead of injecting sketch drawings into graph\nedges, we embed these sequential information into graph nodes only. More\nspecifically, each patch embedding is equipped with a sinusoidal absolute PE to\nhighlight the sequential position in the drawing order. And its neighboring\npatches, ranked by the values of self-attention scores between patch\nembeddings, are equipped with learnable relative PEs to restore the contextual\npositions within a neighborhood. During message aggregation via graph\nconvolutional networks, a node receives both semantic contents from patch\nembeddings and contextual patterns from PEs by its neighbors, arriving at\ndrawing-order-enhanced sketch representations.

First, We leverage the Fisher-Rao norm, a geometrically invariant\nmetric for model complexity, to establish the non-trivial bounds of the\nCross-Entropy Loss-based Rademacher complexity for a ReLU-activated Multi-Layer\nPerceptron.

The\nDS-AL contains a main stream offering an analytical (i.e., closed-form) linear\nsolution, and a compensation stream improving the inherent under-fitting\nlimitation due to adopting linear mapping. The main stream redefines the CIL\nproblem into a Concatenated Recursive Least Squares (C-RLS) task, allowing an\nequivalence between the CIL and its joint-learning counterpart. The\ncompensation stream is governed by a Dual-Activation Compensation (DAC) module.\nThis module re-activates the embedding with a different activation function\nfrom the main stream one, and seeks fitting compensation by projecting the\nembedding to the null space of the main stream's linear mapping.

Despite an increasingly\nlanguage-diverse online community, in which many Internet users consume news in\nmultiple languages, the majority of news recommendation focuses on major,\nresource-rich languages, and English in particular. Moreover, nearly all news\nrecommendation efforts assume monolingual news consumption, whereas more and\nmore users tend to consume information in at least two languages. Accordingly,\nthe existing body of work on news recommendation suffers from a lack of\npublicly available multilingual benchmarks that would catalyze development of\nnews recommenders effective in multilingual settings and for low-resource\nlanguages. Aiming to fill this gap, we introduce xMIND, an open, multilingual\nnews recommendation dataset derived from the English MIND dataset using machine\ntranslation, covering a set of 14 linguistically and geographically diverse\nlanguages, with digital footprints of varying sizes. Using xMIND, we\nsystematically benchmark several state-of-the-art content-based neural news\nrecommenders (NNRs) in both zero-shot (ZS-XLT) and few-shot (FS-XLT)\ncross-lingual transfer scenarios, considering both monolingual and bilingual\nnews consumption patterns. Our findings reveal that (i) current NNRs, even when\nbased on a multilingual language model, suffer from substantial performance\nlosses under ZS-XLT and that (ii) inclusion of target-language data in FS-XLT\ntraining has limited benefits, particularly when combined with a bilingual news\nconsumption. Our findings thus warrant a broader research effort in\nmultilingual and cross-lingual news recommendation.

Investigating and Mitigating Prompt Bias\n  in Factual Knowledge Extraction","summary":"  Recent research shows that pre-trained language models (PLMs) suffer from\n\"prompt bias\" in factual knowledge extraction, i.e., prompts tend to introduce\nbiases toward specific labels. Prompt bias presents a significant challenge in\nassessing the factual knowledge within PLMs. Therefore, this paper aims to\nimprove the reliability of existing benchmarks by thoroughly investigating and\nmitigating prompt bias. We show that: 1) all prompts in the experiments exhibit\nnon-negligible bias, with gradient-based prompts like AutoPrompt and OptiPrompt\ndisplaying significantly higher levels of bias; 2) prompt bias can amplify\nbenchmark accuracy unreasonably by overfitting the test datasets, especially on\nimbalanced datasets like LAMA. Based on these findings, we propose a\nrepresentation-based approach to mitigate the prompt bias during inference\ntime. Specifically, we first estimate the biased representation using\nprompt-only querying, and then remove it from the model's internal\nrepresentations to generate the debiased representations, which are used to\nproduce the final debiased outputs. Experiments across various prompts, PLMs,\nand benchmarks show that our approach can not only correct the overfitted\nperformance caused by prompt bias, but also significantly improve the prompt\nretrieval capability (up to 10% absolute performance gain). These results\nindicate that our approach effectively alleviates prompt bias in knowledge\nevaluation, thereby enhancing the reliability of benchmark assessments.\nHopefully, our plug-and-play approach can be a golden standard to strengthen\nPLMs toward reliable knowledge bases.

However, this assumption\ncan be easily violated in real-world applications, leading to the\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) problem. Understanding how modern over-parameterized\nDNNs behave under non-trivial natural distributional shifts is essential, as\ncurrent theoretical understanding is insufficient. Existing theoretical works\noften provide meaningless results for over-parameterized models in OOD\nscenarios or even contradict empirical findings. To this end, we are\ninvestigating the performance of the over-parameterized model in terms of OOD\ngeneralization under the general benign overfitting conditions. Our analysis\nfocuses on a random feature model and examines non-trivial natural\ndistributional shifts, where the benign overfitting estimators demonstrate a\nconstant excess OOD loss, despite achieving zero excess in-distribution (ID)\nloss. We demonstrate that in this scenario, further increasing the model's\nparameterization can significantly reduce the OOD loss. Intuitively, the\nvariance term of ID loss remains low due to orthogonality of long-tail\nfeatures, meaning overfitting noise during training generally doesn't raise\ntesting loss. However, in OOD cases, distributional shift increases the\nvariance term. Thankfully, the inherent shift is unrelated to individual x,\nmaintaining the orthogonality of long-tail features. Expanding the hidden\ndimension can additionally improve this orthogonality by mapping the features\ninto higher-dimensional spaces, thereby reducing the variance term. We further\nshow that model ensembles also improve OOD loss, akin to increasing model\ncapacity. These insights explain the empirical phenomenon of enhanced OOD\ngeneralization through model ensembles, supported by consistent simulations\nwith theoretical results.\n","authors":["Yifan Hao","Yong Lin","Difan Zou","Tong Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17592v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17588v1","updated":"2024-03-26T10:54:07Z","published":"2024-03-26T10:54:07Z","title":"Forest-ORE: Mining Optimal Rule Ensemble to interpret Random Forest\n  models","summary":"  Random Forest (RF) is well-known as an efficient ensemble learning method in\nterms of predictive performance.

First, We leverage the Fisher-Rao norm, a geometrically invariant\nmetric for model complexity, to establish the non-trivial bounds of the\nCross-Entropy Loss-based Rademacher complexity for a ReLU-activated Multi-Layer\nPerceptron. Then we generalize a complexity-related variable, which is\nsensitive to the changes in model width and the trade-off factors in\nadversarial training.

The\nDS-AL contains a main stream offering an analytical (i.e., closed-form) linear\nsolution, and a compensation stream improving the inherent under-fitting\nlimitation due to adopting linear mapping. The main stream redefines the CIL\nproblem into a Concatenated Recursive Least Squares (C-RLS) task, allowing an\nequivalence between the CIL and its joint-learning counterpart. The\ncompensation stream is governed by a Dual-Activation Compensation (DAC) module.\nThis module re-activates the embedding with a different activation function\nfrom the main stream one, and seeks fitting compensation by projecting the\nembedding to the null space of the main stream's linear mapping.

In recent years, imitation learning that\naims to learn from expert demonstrations has been proposed as a viable\nalternative to solving these problems. Generally speaking, imitation learning\nis designed to learn either the reward (or preference) model or directly the\nbehavioral policy by observing the behavior of an expert. Existing work in\nimitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning has focused on imitation\nprimarily in unconstrained settings (e.g., no limit on fuel consumed by the\nvehicle). However, in many real-world domains, the behavior of an expert is\ngoverned not only by reward (or preference) but also by constraints.

This challenge is even more for regional\nBengali dialects due to unavailability of standardized spelling conventions for\nthese dialects, presence of local and foreign words popular in those regions\nand phonological diversity across different regions. This paper presents an\napproach to this sequence-to-sequence problem by introducing the District\nGuided Tokens (DGT) technique on a new dataset spanning six districts of\nBangladesh. The key idea is to provide the model with explicit information\nabout the regional dialect or \"district\" of the input text before generating\nthe IPA transcription. This is achieved by prepending a district token to the\ninput sequence, effectively guiding the model to understand the unique phonetic\npatterns associated with each district.

Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of DGT, with the ByT5 model achieving\nsuperior performance over word-based models like mT5, BanglaT5, and umT5.

In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we present a novel\nmulti-sound source localization method that can perform localization without\nprior knowledge of the number of sound sources. To achieve this goal, we\npropose an iterative object identification (IOI) module, which can recognize\nsound-making objects in an iterative manner. After finding the regions of\nsound-making objects, we devise object similarity-aware clustering (OSC) loss\nto guide the IOI module to effectively combine regions of the same object but\nalso distinguish between different objects and backgrounds. It enables our\nmethod to perform accurate localization of sound-making objects without any\nprior knowledge. Extensive experimental results on the MUSIC and VGGSound\nbenchmarks show the significant performance improvements of the proposed method\nover the existing methods for both single and multi-source.

This paper introduces a novel\nalgorithm designed to augment defective samples, thereby enhancing AD\nperformance. The proposed method tailors the blended latent diffusion model for\ndefect sample generation, employing a diffusion model to generate defective\nsamples in the latent space. A feature editing process, controlled by a\n``trimap\" mask and text prompts, refines the generated samples. The image\ngeneration inference process is structured into three stages: a free diffusion\nstage, an editing diffusion stage, and an online decoder adaptation stage. This\nsophisticated inference strategy yields high-quality synthetic defective\nsamples with diverse pattern variations, leading to significantly improved AD\naccuracies based on the augmented training set.

Among these, the policy module is essential\nfor deciding what to do in response to user input. This policy is trained by\nreinforcement learning algorithms by taking advantage of an environment in\nwhich an agent receives feedback in the form of a reward signal. The current\ndialogue systems, however, only provide meagre and simplistic rewards.\nInvestigating intrinsic motivation reinforcement learning algorithms is the\ngoal of this study. Through this, the agent can quickly accelerate training and\nimprove its capacity to judge the quality of its actions by teaching it an\ninternal incentive system. In particular, we adapt techniques for random\nnetwork distillation and curiosity-driven reinforcement learning to measure the\nfrequency of state visits and encourage exploration by using semantic\nsimilarity between utterances. Experimental results on MultiWOZ, a\nheterogeneous dataset, show that intrinsic motivation-based debate systems\noutperform policies that depend on extrinsic incentives. By adopting random\nnetwork distillation, for example, which is trained using semantic similarity\nbetween user-system dialogues, an astounding average success rate of 73% is\nachieved. This is a significant improvement over the baseline Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO), which has an average success rate of 60%. In addition,\nperformance indicators such as booking rates and completion rates show a 10%\nrise over the baseline.

This study provides an in-depth\nanalysis of the distribution and types of noise in the widely used BIRD-Bench\nbenchmark and the impact of noise on models. While BIRD-Bench was created to\nmodel dirty and noisy database values, it was not created to contain noise and\nerrors in the questions and gold queries.

Recognising the relevance of\nglobal and trans-national policies towards sustainable land management\npractices, the GSP elected data harmonisation and exchange as one of its key\nlines of action. Building upon international standards and previous work\ntowards a global soil data ontology, an improved domain model was eventually\ndeveloped within the GSP [54], the basis for a Global Soil Information System\n(GloSIS).

Therefore, recommending notes aligned with user interests has\nbecome a crucial task. Existing online methods only input notes into BERT-based\nmodels to generate note embeddings for assessing similarity. However, they may\nunderutilize some important cues, e.g., hashtags or categories, which represent\nthe key concepts of notes. Indeed, learning to generate hashtags/categories can\npotentially enhance note embeddings, both of which compress key note\ninformation into limited content. Besides, Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nsignificantly outperformed BERT in understanding natural languages. It is\npromising to introduce LLMs into note recommendation. In this paper, we propose\na novel unified framework called NoteLLM, which leverages LLMs to address the\nitem-to-item (I2I) note recommendation. Specifically, we utilize Note\nCompression Prompt to compress a note into a single special token, and further\nlearn the potentially related notes' embeddings via a contrastive learning\napproach. Moreover, we use NoteLLM to summarize the note and generate the\nhashtag/category automatically through instruction tuning.

Nevertheless, the problem is not trivial when\nshaping diffusion models to animate static image (i.e., image-to-video\ngeneration). The difficulty originates from the aspect that the diffusion\nprocess of subsequent animated frames should not only preserve the faithful\nalignment with the given image but also pursue temporal coherence among\nadjacent frames. To alleviate this, we present TRIP, a new recipe of\nimage-to-video diffusion paradigm that pivots on image noise prior derived from\nstatic image to jointly trigger inter-frame relational reasoning and ease the\ncoherent temporal modeling via temporal residual learning. Technically, the\nimage noise prior is first attained through one-step backward diffusion process\nbased on both static image and noised video latent codes. Next, TRIP executes a\nresidual-like dual-path scheme for noise prediction: 1) a shortcut path that\ndirectly takes image noise prior as the reference noise of each frame to\namplify the alignment between the first frame and subsequent frames; 2) a\nresidual path that employs 3D-UNet over noised video and static image latent\ncodes to enable inter-frame relational reasoning, thereby easing the learning\nof the residual noise for each frame. Furthermore, both reference and residual\nnoise of each frame are dynamically merged via attention mechanism for final\nvideo generation.

In this study, we conduct a meticulous\nanalysis of the MovieLens dataset and explain the potential impact of using the\ndataset for evaluating recommendation algorithms. We make a few main findings\nfrom our analysis. First, there are significant differences in user\ninteractions at the different stages when a user interacts with the MovieLens\nplatform. The early interactions largely define the user portrait which affects\nthe subsequent interactions. Second, user interactions are highly affected by\nthe candidate movies that are recommended by the platform's internal\nrecommendation algorithm(s). Third, changing the order of user interactions\nmakes it more difficult for sequential algorithms to capture the progressive\ninteraction process.

In summary, the MovieLens platform\ndemonstrates an efficient and effective way of collecting user preferences to\naddress cold-starts. However, models that achieve excellent recommendation\naccuracy on the MovieLens dataset may not demonstrate superior performance in\npractice, for at least two kinds of differences: (i) the differences in the\ncontexts of user-item interaction generation, and (ii) the differences in user\nknowledge about the item collections.

We hope that this survey can provide the context and guidance\nneeded to explore this interesting and emerging topic.\n","authors":["Lei Li","Yongfeng Zhang","Dugang Liu","Li Chen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01157v2.pdf","comment":"Published as a conference paper at LREC-COLING 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13597v2","updated":"2024-03-23T17:05:15Z","published":"2024-03-20T13:44:30Z","title":"No more optimization rules: LLM-enabled policy-based multi-modal query\n  optimizer","summary":"  Large language model (LLM) has marked a pivotal moment in the field of\nmachine learning and deep learning. Recently its capability for query planning\nhas been investigated, including both single-modal and multi-modal queries.\nHowever, there is no work on the query optimization capability of LLM. As a\ncritical (or could even be the most important) step that significantly impacts\nthe execution performance of the query plan, such analysis and attempts should\nnot be missed. From another aspect, existing query optimizers are usually\nrule-based or rule-based + cost-based, i.e., they are dependent on manually\ncreated rules to complete the query plan rewrite/transformation. Given the fact\nthat modern optimizers include hundreds to thousands of rules, designing a\nmulti-modal query optimizer following a similar way is significantly\ntime-consuming since we will have to enumerate as many multi-modal optimization\nrules as possible, which has not been well addressed today. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the query optimization ability of LLM and use LLM to design LaPuda,\na novel LLM and Policy based multi-modal query optimizer. Instead of\nenumerating specific and detailed rules, LaPuda only needs a few abstract\npolicies to guide LLM in the optimization, by which much time and human effort\nare saved. Furthermore, to prevent LLM from making mistakes or negative\noptimization, we borrow the idea of gradient descent and propose a guided cost\ndescent (GCD) algorithm to perform the optimization, such that the optimization\ncan be kept in the correct direction. In our evaluation, our methods\nconsistently outperform the baselines in most cases.

To this end, we propose a method named\nGRIP to alleviate the noisy label problem for both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets.

Soft label supervision\nreduces overfitting on noisy labels and learns inter-class similarities to\nbenefit classification. Furthermore, an instance purification operation\nglobally identifies noisy labels by measuring the difference between each\ntraining sample and its class soft label. Through operations at both group and\ninstance levels, our approach integrates the advantages of noise-robust and\nnoise-cleaning methods and remarkably alleviates the performance degradation\ncaused by noisy labels.

However, over-smoothing has always hindered\nGNNs from going deeper and capturing multi-hop neighbors.

So, can we propose a novel framework to\ncombine GNN and Transformer, integrating both GNN's local information\naggregation and Transformer's global information modeling ability to eliminate\nthe over-smoothing problem? To realize this, this paper proposes a\ncollaborative learning scheme for GNN-Transformer and constructs GTC\narchitecture.

While current studies primarily focus on\nrecognition and generalization abilities, our research pioneers an\ninvestigation into the reliability of SER methods in the presence of semantic\ndata shifts and explores how to exert fine-grained control over various\nattributes inherent in speech signals to enhance speech emotion modeling. In\nthis paper, we first introduce MSAC-SERNet, a novel unified SER framework\ncapable of simultaneously handling both single-corpus and cross-corpus SER.\nSpecifically, concentrating exclusively on the speech emotion attribute, a\nnovel CNN-based SER model is presented to extract discriminative emotional\nrepresentations, guided by additive margin softmax loss. Considering\ninformation overlap between various speech attributes, we propose a novel\nlearning paradigm based on correlations of different speech attributes, termed\nMultiple Speech Attribute Control (MSAC), which empowers the proposed SER model\nto simultaneously capture fine-grained emotion-related features while\nmitigating the negative impact of emotion-agnostic representations.\nFurthermore, we make a first attempt to examine the reliability of the\nMSAC-SERNet framework using out-of-distribution detection methods. Experiments\non both single-corpus and cross-corpus SER scenarios indicate that MSAC-SERNet\nnot only consistently outperforms the baseline in all aspects, but achieves\nsuperior performance compared to state-of-the-art SER approaches.\n","authors":["Yu Pan","Yuguang Yang","Yuheng Huang","Jixun Yao","Jingjing Yin","Yanni Hu","Heng Lu","Lei Ma","Jianjun Zhao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04025v3.pdf","comment":"12 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15226v1","updated":"2024-03-22T14:20:34Z","published":"2024-03-22T14:20:34Z","title":"Not All Attention is Needed: Parameter and Computation Efficient\n  Transfer Learning for Multi-modal Large Language Models","summary":"  In this paper, we propose a novel parameter and computation efficient tuning\nmethod for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), termed Efficient\nAttention Skipping (EAS).

In this\npaper, we introduce a novel one-stage method for face re-aging combined with\nportrait style transfer, executed in a single generative step. We leverage\nexisting face re-aging and style transfer networks, both trained within the\nsame PR domain.

Traditional methods\nhave been constrained to certain editing types, limiting their ability to meet\nthe wide range of user demands. In this paper, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel\ntraining-free framework designed to simplify video editing into two primary\nsteps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model (e.g.\nInstructPix2Pix, InstantID, etc) to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an\nexisting image-to-video generation model (e.g. I2VGen-XL) for DDIM inversion\nand feature injection. In the first stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing\nimage editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks.\nBeyond the traditional prompt-based editing methods, AnyV2V also can support\nnovel video editing tasks, including reference-based style transfer,\nsubject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by\nprevious methods. In the second stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing\nimage-to-video models to perform DDIM inversion and intermediate feature\ninjection to maintain the appearance and motion consistency with the source\nvideo. On the prompt-based editing, we show that AnyV2V can outperform the\nprevious best approach by 35\\% on prompt alignment, and 25\\% on human\npreference.

Existing black-box RAG methods typically fine-tune\nthe retriever to cater to LLMs' preferences and concatenate all the retrieved\ndocuments as the input, which suffers from two issues: (1) Ignorance of Factual\nInformation.

To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce StreamingT2V, an autoregressive approach for long video generation of\n80, 240, 600, 1200 or more frames with smooth transitions. The key components\nare:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM),\nwhich conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the\nprevious chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk\ntransitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation\nmodule, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first\nvideo chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a\nrandomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer\nautoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between\nchunks.

Therefore, safeguarding face\nrecognition systems against FPA is of utmost importance. Although existing\nlearning-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models can achieve outstanding\ndetection performance, they lack generalization capability and suffer\nsignificant performance drops in unforeseen environments. Many methodologies\nseek to use auxiliary modality data (e.g., depth and infrared maps) during the\npresentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation.

In this paper, we devise an\naccurate and robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing system named M3FAS to\novercome the issues above. The primary innovation of this work lies in the\nfollowing aspects: (1) To achieve robust PAD, our system combines visual and\nauditory modalities using three commonly available sensors: camera, speaker,\nand microphone; (2) We design a novel two-branch neural network with three\nhierarchical feature aggregation modules to perform cross-modal feature fusion;\n(3).

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel recommendation approach called LSVCR by\nleveraging user interaction histories with both videos and comments, so as to\njointly conduct personalized video and comment recommendation. Specifically,\nour approach consists of two key components, namely sequential recommendation\n(SR) model and supplemental large language model (LLM) recommender.

In recent years, neural retrievers based on pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLM), such as dual-encoders, have achieved huge success. Yet,\nstudies have found that the performance of dual-encoders are often limited due\nto the neglecting of the interaction information between queries and candidate\npassages. Therefore, various interaction paradigms have been proposed to\nimprove the performance of vanilla dual-encoders.

In legal case retrieval, however, collecting\nrelevance feedback faces a couple of challenges that are difficult to resolve\nunder existing feedback paradigms. First, legal case retrieval is a complex\ntask as users often need to understand the relationship between legal cases in\ndetail to correctly judge their relevance.

However,\ntraditional VAC methods have overlooked the complexity of action repetitions,\nsuch as interruptions and the variability in cycle duration. Our research\naddresses the shortfall by introducing a novel approach to VAC, called\nIrregular Video Action Counting (IVAC). IVAC prioritizes modeling irregular\nrepetition patterns in videos, which we define through two primary aspects:\nInter-cycle Consistency and Cycle-interval Inconsistency. Inter-cycle\nConsistency ensures homogeneity in the spatial-temporal representations of\ncycle segments, signifying action uniformity within cycles. Cycle-interval\ninconsistency highlights the importance of distinguishing between cycle\nsegments and intervals based on their inherent content differences. To\nencapsulate these principles, we propose a new methodology that includes\nconsistency and inconsistency modules, supported by a unique pull-push loss\n(P2L) mechanism. The IVAC-P2L model applies a pull loss to promote coherence\namong cycle segment features and a push loss to clearly distinguish features of\ncycle segments from interval segments. Empirical evaluations conducted on the\nRepCount dataset demonstrate that the IVAC-P2L model sets a new benchmark in\nVAC task performance. Furthermore, the model demonstrates exceptional\nadaptability and generalization across various video contents, outperforming\nexisting models on two additional datasets, UCFRep and Countix, without the\nneed for dataset-specific optimization.

To address this\nchallenge, we introduce the concept of Generative Temporal Nursing (GTN), where\nwe aim to alter the generative process on the fly during inference to improve\ncontrol over the temporal dynamics and enable generation of longer videos.

Fundamentally,\nrecommender systems aim to identify user interests based on historical\ninteractions and recommend suitable items. However, existing works overlook two\nkey challenges: (1) an interest corresponds to a potentially large set of\nrelated items, and (2) the lack of explicit, fine-grained exploitation of KG\ninformation and interest connectivity. This leads to an inability to reflect\ndistinctions between entities and interests when modeling them in a single way.\nAdditionally, the granularity of concepts in the knowledge graphs used for\nrecommendations tends to be coarse, failing to match the fine-grained nature of\nuser interests. This homogenization limits the precise exploitation of\nknowledge graph data and interest connectivity. To address these limitations,\nwe introduce a novel embedding-based model called InBox. Specifically, various\nknowledge graph entities and relations are embedded as points or boxes, while\nuser interests are modeled as boxes encompassing interaction history.\nRepresenting interests as boxes enables containing collections of item points\nrelated to that interest. We further propose that an interest comprises diverse\nbasic concepts, and box intersection naturally supports concept combination.\nAcross three training steps, InBox significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods like HAKG and KGIN on recommendation tasks. Further analysis provides\nmeaningful insights into the variable value of different KG data for\nrecommendations. In summary, InBox advances recommender systems through\nbox-based interest and concept modeling for sophisticated knowledge graph\nexploitation.\n","authors":["Zezhong Xu","Yincen Qu","Wen Zhang","Lei Liang","Huajun Chen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12649v1.pdf","comment":"VLDB 2024 under submission"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05903v2","updated":"2024-03-19T10:32:16Z","published":"2023-11-10T07:13:06Z","title":"Establishing Performance Baselines in Fine-Tuning, Retrieval-Augmented\n  Generation and Soft-Prompting for Non-Specialist LLM Users","summary":"  Research into methods for improving the performance of large language models\n(LLMs) through fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and\nsoft-prompting has tended to focus on the use of highly technical or high-cost\ntechniques, making many of the newly discovered approaches comparatively\ninaccessible to non-technical users.

Existing sequential recommendation models\noften fail to capture long-term dependencies or are too complex, complicating\nthe fulfillment of Meituan Waimai's unique business needs. To better model user\ninterests, we consider selecting relevant sub-sequences from users' extensive\nhistorical behaviors based on their preferences. In this specific scenario,\nwe've noticed that the contexts in which users interact have a significant\nimpact on their preferences. For this purpose, we introduce a novel method\ncalled Context-based Fast Recommendation Strategy to tackle the issue of long\nsequences. We first identify contexts that share similar user preferences with\nthe target context and then locate the corresponding PoIs based on these\nidentified contexts. This approach eliminates the necessity to select a\nsub-sequence for every candidate PoI, thereby avoiding high time complexity.\nSpecifically, we implement a prototype-based approach to pinpoint contexts that\nmirror similar user preferences. To amplify accuracy and interpretability, we\nemploy JS divergence of PoI attributes such as categories and prices as a\nmeasure of similarity between contexts. A temporal graph integrating both\nprototype and context nodes helps incorporate temporal information. We then\nidentify appropriate prototypes considering both target contexts and short-term\nuser preferences. Following this, we utilize contexts aligned with these\nprototypes to generate a sub-sequence, aimed at predicting CTR and CTCVR scores\nwith target attention. Since its inception in 2023, this strategy has been\nadopted in Meituan Waimai's display recommender system, leading to a 4.6% surge\nin CTR and a 4.2% boost in GMV.\n","authors":["Zhichao Feng","Junjiie Xie","Kaiyuan Li","Yu Qin","Pengfei Wang","Qianzhong Li","Bin Yin","Xiang Li","Wei Lin","Shangguang Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12566v1.pdf","comment":"9 pages, accepted by WWW 2024 Industry Track"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18590v3","updated":"2024-03-19T07:56:40Z","published":"2024-02-11T00:24:17Z","title":"Exploring the Impact of Large Language Models on Recommender Systems: An\n  Extensive Review","summary":"  The paper underscores the significance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in\nreshaping recommender systems, attributing their value to unique reasoning\nabilities absent in traditional recommenders.

Existing GR models\ncommonly employ maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for optimization: this\ninvolves maximizing the likelihood of a single relevant docid given an input\nquery, with the assumption that the likelihood for each docid is independent of\nthe other docids in the list. We refer to these models as the pointwise\napproach in this paper. While the pointwise approach has been shown to be\neffective in the context of GR, it is considered sub-optimal due to its\ndisregard for the fundamental principle that ranking involves making\npredictions about lists. In this paper, we address this limitation by\nintroducing an alternative listwise approach, which empowers the GR model to\noptimize the relevance at the docid list level. Specifically, we view the\ngeneration of a ranked docid list as a sequence learning process: at each step\nwe learn a subset of parameters that maximizes the corresponding generation\nlikelihood of the $i$-th docid given the (preceding) top $i-1$ docids. To\nformalize the sequence learning process, we design a positional conditional\nprobability for GR. To alleviate the potential impact of beam search on the\ngeneration quality during inference, we perform relevance calibration on the\ngeneration likelihood of model-generated docids according to relevance grades.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on representative binary and multi-graded\nrelevance datasets.
